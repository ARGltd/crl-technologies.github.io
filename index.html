        CRL runs as an authenticated API under your existing infrastructure — your clients

        Behind the scenes, the CRL engine manages conditional leverage payoffs and state transitions
        so that fewer clients blow up in the early months and more of your client acquisition cost
        turns into recurring, compounding margin.

        <h2 class="headline">Who we are and what we really do</h2>
        <p>
          We build a leverage engine for professional clients that is explicitly designed to turn a high churn leveraged business
          into a higher margin, longer lived one.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sit as a calculation and payoff engine under the products you already sell and reshape when and how leverage applies.
          Instead of one off P and L spikes and early blow ups, more of your “almost good” clients stay in the game long enough
          to become your best clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            In one line: CRL lets you keep selling leverage, but in a way that reduces ruin events and increases client lifetime value,
            using the infrastructure and risk models you already have.

      <h2 class="headline">What changes in your numbers</h2>
      <p>
        CRL is not a new asset class. It is a leverage engine that reshapes 
        how risk and payoff are distributed across time. The result is simple:
        fewer early blow-ups, a longer useful life for the same clients, and
        leverage economics that are easier to defend internally.

      <div class="metrics-grid">
        <div class="metric">
          <h3>Fewer early wipe-outs</h3>
          <p>
            In internal Monte Carlo testing on 1,000,000 scenarios, CRL-style
            conditional leverage structures reduced early account wipe-outs
            (first 30 days) by <strong>84.8%</strong> compared
            to equivalent fixed-leverage positions.

          <h3>Longer client relationships</h3>
          <p>
            Under the same testing assumptions, median relationship duration
            increased by <strong>6.8 months</strong> for
            comparable leverage profiles, as accounts were less likely to be
            wiped out by early adverse volatility.

            compliance and the board than traditional “all-or-nothing”
            leverage.

            <p>
              We take the leverage you already offer and turn it into conditional leverage. Until the market confirms a move, your
              client is effectively linear. When the trigger is hit, the whole move from entry is multiplied by a leverage factor
              with a clear payoff and a clear hedge.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result is more margin over time on the same flow, with fewer accounts going to zero in a single move.

            <p>
              You already know which clients are statistically close to a blow up. CRL lets you move these clients into a more
              intelligent leverage path without asking them to stop trading and without forcing you to give up revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
              The client sees a product that protects them from the usual margin call spiral. You see a book where more of your
              at risk clients survive and keep trading.

        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
          CRL does not ask you to rebuild your stack or change how you book trades. It plugs into your
          existing data, risk and dealing flows and can be rolled out in four concrete steps: from read-only
          inventory visibility, to a small hedged pilot, to portfolio-level automation and capital integration.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
          On the Technology page we show the full dealer roadmap, including how premiums, spreads and disciplined
          hedging combine to produce a stable, risk-controlled margin at portfolio level.

    <!-- Churn angle -->
    <section class="section" id="churn">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2 class="headline">Built for the economics of churn</h2>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;"></p>
          The leveraged industry has accepted extremely high churn in active clients as “the nature of the game”. Public data show
          that most losses and departures are concentrated in the first months of activity, while the clients who survive beyond
          twelve months generate several times the lifetime value.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;max-width:780px;"></p>
          Players that shifted from churn and burn to retention have already seen client lifetime value and revenue stability
          improve sharply. But most of this progress lives in limits, wrappers and coaching, not in a different payoff engine.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;max-width:780px;"></p>
          CRL is built exactly for that gap. Instead of asking clients to behave perfectly around a fragile payoff, we redesign
          the payoff itself so that normal human behaviour is less likely to end in a permanent wipe out. If you are already
          investing in retention, client education and product governance, CRL gives you a leverage engine that finally matches
          that strategy.

        <h2 class="headline" style="text-align:center;">How a CRL pilot actually works</h2>
        <p>
          We do not start with theory, we start with your book. A CRL pilot is a short, controlled
          experiment on a clearly delimited segment of your clients and products.

            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              Under a light NDA we work with a small team from product, risk and IT. You share
              anonymised aggregates on churn, margin usage and loss distribution on your leveraged
              clients. We map where CRL-style structures would have made a meaningful difference
              without increasing your gross risk.

            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">Controlled pilot on a clear segment</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              We configure one or two CRL structures on a limited segment of your book
              (for example: a subset of FX/indices, a specific region, or a bucket of clients
              at higher risk of churn). Integration is via the CRL API, with your existing price
              feed and order flow. We monitor behaviour, risk and P&amp;L jointly.

            <span class="badge">Step 3</span>
            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">Decision and scaling</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              At the end of the pilot you receive a compact impact report on churn, behaviour and
              P&amp;L for the tested segment. You can then either decommission the pilot or scale
              CRL to a broader scope under your own governance framework.

          Commercially, CRL is offered as a software product: an initial setup fee for the pilot
          and, if you scale, a fee linked to CRL usage and notional processed. Details are agreed
          with each institution.
