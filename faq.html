            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">Is CRL a broker or a trading platform?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              No. CRL is a leverage engine and payoff layer. It does not hold client funds, does not run
              execution venues and does not replace your trading platform. It consumes your prices and order
              instructions and returns the payoffs and states of a conditional leverage structure that you
              can offer as a product.

            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">Who can use CRL?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              CRL is offered only to licensed professional institutions such as brokers, banks and similar
              entities. We do not onboard retail clients and we do not distribute CRL directly to end clients.
              You remain responsible for client classification and suitability under your local rules.

            <span class="badge">Scope</span>
            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">Is CRL a single product or a toolkit?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              At its core CRL is an engine that can support multiple structures. In practice, institutions
              usually start with a narrow, standardised configuration such as CRL Base and only then explore
              variants. This keeps product governance and risk review focused.

            <span class="badge">Instruments</span>
            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">What instruments and markets does CRL support?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              The engine is instrument-agnostic by design. Current work focuses on the asset classes that
              dominate leveraged retail-like flows handled by professional intermediaries, such as FX majors,
              equity indices and selected single-name or crypto underlyings. Extending to other instruments
              is a matter of configuration and risk approval on your side.

            <span class="badge">Risk</span>
            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">How does CRL change risk compared to standard leverage?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              CRL does not remove risk and does not guarantee positive outcomes. It reshapes when leverage
              appears and how it is applied over the life of a position. In many use cases this reduces the
              frequency of early, permanent blow ups for clients, while keeping the exposure transparent for
              your risk tools. Backtesting and scenario analysis are part of the gated materials pack.

            <span class="badge">Regulation</span>
            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">How do you think about regulation and product classification?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              CRL is a payoff and engine that sits on top of instruments and platforms you already use.
              Classification is done by each institution within its own frameworks and with its own advisors.
              We design structures so that they can be mapped to existing categories rather than creating a
              completely new one, and we provide documentation to support your internal process.

            <span class="badge">Losses</span>
            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">Does CRL eliminate margin calls or client losses?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              No. Clients can still lose money and capital. The goal is not to make leverage safe in an
              absolute sense, but to make it less fragile. CRL aims to reduce the number of clients who
              disappear after a small number of trades and to make the risk path more compatible with a
              long term relationship.

            <span class="badge">Pricing</span>
            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">Who owns the price used by CRL?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              You do. CRL does not act as a price source. The engine consumes the prices that your systems
              already use as source of truth and applies the agreed payoff rules to those prices. This keeps
              P&amp;L, best execution and audit aligned with your existing processes.

            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">How complex is integration from an IT perspective?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              The public surface is a small set of authenticated API endpoints. Most of the work is not
              technical difficulty but alignment: deciding where CRL sits in your architecture, how you
              map positions and accounts, and how you want to monitor states and payoffs. We provide an
              OpenAPI specification, a Postman collection and example client code to accelerate this step.

            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">What about latency, availability and monitoring?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              The engine is engineered not to become the bottleneck in your flow, with latency targets
              aligned to professional leveraged trading environments. It exposes metrics and logs that can
              be integrated into your monitoring stack. Concrete performance figures and operational targets
              are part of the technical materials shared under NDA.

            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              Requests to the engine are signed with HMAC keys dedicated to each institution, and traffic
              is encrypted in transit. Additional controls such as mutual TLS, IP allowlists and stricter
              credential handling can be added to align with your security policies. Full security notes are
              available in the technical pack under NDA.

            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">What happens if the CRL engine is unavailable?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              CRL does not replace your core trading or custody systems, so an outage does not stop your
              platform. In practice we design deployments with high availability and clear failure modes:
              how requests are retried, how states are reconciled, and how you want to treat new CRL orders
              during a disruption. Target availability and recovery objectives are agreed as part of a pilot.

            <span class="badge">Testing</span>
            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">Can we test with synthetic data before production?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              Yes. Standard onboarding includes access to a sandbox environment and test credentials, so your
              teams can validate integration and behaviour with synthetic or historical data before any live
              positions are created. The API Validation Kit is designed exactly for this step.

            <span class="badge">Audit</span>
            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">How does CRL support audit and regulatory reporting?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              Every request and state change in the engine can be logged with enough detail to reconstruct
              the lifecycle of a position. Logs and events can be exported for your own audit and reporting
              tools. For institutions that require it, we can provide additional guidance on how to align
              CRL records with existing regulatory reporting frameworks.

            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">Is CRL protected as intellectual property?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              CRL is being protected through a combination of patent filings, contractual controls and
              gated documentation. We do not publish full structural details publicly. Institutions that
              enter diligence see the necessary materials under NDA.

            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              The core idea of conditional, retroactive leverage looks simple at a distance, but the details
              of state management, edge cases and client-facing behaviour are not. CRL comes with an engine,
              operational practices and documentation that have already been shaped and tested. Most
              institutions find that the time and attention saved compared to a full in-house build is
              a material part of the value.

            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              We usually combine a clear, time-bound engagement for integration and support with a usage-based
              component linked to CRL-enhanced activity. Specific terms depend on scale, geography and scope of
              deployment and are discussed directly rather than published as a generic tariff.

            <h3 class="title" style="margin-top:8px;">What is the typical timeline from first call to pilot?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              A realistic range is four to eight weeks. A first call and eligibility check usually happen in
              week one, followed by NDA and documentation review in weeks one and two. Weeks two to four are
              used for technical design, and weeks four to six for sandbox testing. A small, controlled pilot
              can then start, subject to your internal approvals.

          If you have questions that are not covered here, the fastest route is to share them ahead of a call.
          We can then prepare specific answers and, where appropriate, involve external advisors during your
          internal process.
