    <!-- Section 1: What the engine really does -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h1 class="headline">How the CRL engine works</h1>
        <p class="body-lg" style="margin-top:16px;max-width:780px;">
          Technically, CRL is a leverage engine that sits between your price feed and your order
          management. It does not replace your platform and it does not touch execution or custody.
          It receives prices and order instructions, maintains a state for each position, and returns
          the payoffs and settlements of a conditional, retroactive leverage structure that your
          clients can trade as a product.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:16px;max-width:780px;">
          The core design principle is simple: until a specific trigger is hit, the client behaves as if they were
          essentially linear. When the trigger is confirmed, the whole move from entry is multiplied according to
          a predefined rule, with a payoff that can be hedged and reported using standard tools.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2: From linear to conditional leverage -->
    <section class="section alt">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2 class="headline">From linear exposure to conditional leverage</h2>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          CRL does not add hidden exposure to your book. It reshapes <em>when</em> leverage appears and how it
          is accounted for. Each CRL position lives in a small, finite set of states that your risk team can read
          in plain language. In risk terms, you move from an always-leveraged profile, dove il cliente è esposto dal primo tick,
          a una struttura in cui la leva compare solo quando il movimento che vi interessa è realmente avvenuto.
        </p>

        <div class="steps-timeline" style="margin-top:28px;">
          <div class="step-card">
            <div class="step-number">1</div>
            <h3 class="step-title">Pre-trigger: essentially linear</h3>
            <p class="caption" style="margin-top:8px;">
              The client enters a CRL trade. Until the trigger level is reached, the position behaves like a
              non-leveraged exposure with a clearly defined notional and direction. There is no hidden leverage in
              the book at this stage.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="step-card">
            <div class="step-number">2</div>
            <h3 class="step-title">Trigger: activation and retro calculation</h3>
            <p class="caption" style="margin-top:8px;">
              When the market reaches the agreed trigger, the engine locks the path from entry and applies the
              leverage rule to that whole move. At this moment the position becomes a leveraged payoff with an
              explicit strike, notional and settlement formula.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="step-card">
            <div class="step-number">3</div>
            <h3 class="step-title">Post-trigger: settlement and closure</h3>
            <p class="caption" style="margin-top:8px;">
              Once activated, the position follows a clear, bounded payoff until termination. The engine returns
              the resulting P&amp;L, and your systems treat it as they would treat any other structured payoff:
              settlement, booking and reporting follow your normal procedures.

        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          CRL is built to live on your own market data and infrastructure. It does not generate prices and it does
          not become a second book of record. Your systems remain the source of truth; CRL is a calculation and
          payoff engine that reacts to what you feed it.

            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              The engine receives your price feed, product configuration and order instructions. For each client
              trade it tracks the relevant state (entry, trigger, termination) without altering your existing order
              routing or execution venues.

            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              Each CRL position is stored with explicit states and parameters that your risk and product teams can
              read: current status, potential activation level, realised trigger, and payoff parameters. This makes
              it possible to run monitoring, stress and exposure views using the same tools you already use.

            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              The engine returns deterministic payoffs and settlements for each position, together with the
              information required for booking and reporting. You decide how these flows are mapped into your
              existing systems (accounts, ledgers, reports).

        <h2 class="headline">Integration, security and operations</h2>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          From an engineering perspective, CRL is an authenticated API layer and a stateful engine behind it.
          It is designed to look familiar to teams that already integrate with trading, pricing or risk APIs
          and to fit into your existing security and monitoring practices, without introducing a new book of record.
        </p>

        <div class="p-grid" style="margin-top:24px;">
          <article class="card">
            <h3 class="title">API surface</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              The public surface is a small set of REST endpoints for pricing and state updates. Response times in
              testing are in the low tens of milliseconds, suitable for professional trading environments without
              adding perceptible latency to your clients.

            <h3 class="title">Authentication &amp; transport</h3>
            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              Requests are signed with HMAC keys dedicated to each institution. mTLS and IP controls can be added
              on your side and ours to align with your security policies. No client secrets are exposed to the
              engine; keys and permissions are managed at institutional level.

            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              The engine emits operational metrics and logs that can be integrated into your monitoring stack.
              Each call and each state change can be traced, which supports both internal governance and external
              review when needed.

          The most useful conversation is not abstract. It is to look at how CRL would sit next to your current
          products, platforms and risk views, and what a small, controlled pilot would look like.
