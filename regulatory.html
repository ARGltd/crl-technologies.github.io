  <h1>Regulatory Disclosures</h1>

  <p>Last updated: November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Nature of our services</h2>
  <p>
    CRL Technologies, Inc. develops and licenses calculation engine
    software ("CRL") to regulated financial institutions. We do not
    provide investment services to retail clients, we do not execute
    trades, and we do not hold client money or client financial instruments.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No offer to retail clients</h2>
  <p>
    Information on this website is directed exclusively at professional /
    institutional counterparties, such as investment firms, banks and
    similar regulated entities, in jurisdictions where they may lawfully
    receive such information. It is not an offer or solicitation to any
    person in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be
    unlawful.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Responsibility of client institutions</h2>
  <p>
    Our institutional clients remain fully responsible for product
    governance, client classification, suitability and appropriateness
    assessments, disclosures, and any regulatory reporting associated
    with their use of CRL-based products.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Risk warning</h2>
  <p>
    Leveraged and derivative products involve a high degree of risk and
    are not suitable for all investors. The use of CRL does not eliminate
    the risk of loss or margin calls. Past or simulated performance is
    not a reliable indicator of future results.
  </p>
