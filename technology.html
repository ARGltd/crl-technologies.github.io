    <!-- Section 1: What the engine really does -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h1 class="headline">How the CRL engine works</h1>
        <p class="body-lg" style="margin-top:16px;max-width:780px;">
          Technically, CRL is a leverage engine that sits between your price feed and your order
          management. It does not replace your platform and it does not touch execution or custody.
          It receives prices and order instructions, maintains a state for each position, and returns
          the payoffs and settlements of a conditional, retroactive leverage structure that your
          clients can trade as a product.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:16px;max-width:780px;">
          The core design principle is simple: until a specific trigger is hit, the client behaves as if they were
          essentially linear. When the trigger is confirmed, the whole move from entry is multiplied according to
          a predefined rule, with a payoff that can be hedged and reported using standard tools.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- For CTO and architects -->
    <section class="section alt" id="for-cto">

        <h2 class="headline">For your CTO and architects</h2>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          CRL is designed as a narrow, well-defined engine sitting between your price feed and your
          order / risk systems. No custody, no execution, no client-facing UI: just deterministic
          payoff calculations that your own systems can book, hedge and report.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          <strong>Integration surface.</strong> REST API over mTLS with HMAC authentication per
          institution. You send instrument, direction, size and configuration parameters; the engine
          returns a full payoff path and a small set of risk / margin metrics. Idempotent endpoints
          with correlation IDs keep your audit trails clean.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          <strong>Security and isolation.</strong> mTLS, IP allow-listing and HMAC keys segregated
          per institution. CRL never stores client login credentials or payment details. Logs are
          append-only and compatible with WORM / immutable storage if you require it.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          <strong>Performance and observability.</strong> The engine is deterministic and optimised
          for low double-digit millisecond latency on typical payloads. Standard metrics for latency,
          error rates and per-tenant throughput mean your NOC can treat CRL like any other core
          service.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          <strong>Tooling.</strong> We provide an OpenAPI specification, a Postman collection and
          example client code so your team can exercise the API on day one. A more opinionated SDK
          can be added if needed.

        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          CRL does not add hidden exposure to your book. It reshapes <em>when</em> leverage appears and how it
          is accounted for. Each CRL position lives in a small, finite set of states that your risk team can read
          in plain language. In risk terms, you move from an always-leveraged profile, you move from an always-leveraged profile, where the client is exposed from the first tick,
          to a structure where leverage only appears once the move you care about has actually happened.

        </p>

            <p class="caption" style="margin-top:8px;">
              The client enters a CRL trade. Until the trigger level is reached, the position behaves like a
              non-leveraged exposure with a clearly defined notional and direction. There is no hidden leverage in
              the book at this stage.

            <p class="caption" style="margin-top:8px;">
              When the market reaches the agreed trigger, the engine locks the path from entry and applies the
              leverage rule to that whole move. At this moment the position becomes a leveraged payoff with an
              explicit strike, notional and settlement formula.

            <p class="caption" style="margin-top:8px;">
              Once activated, the position follows a clear, bounded payoff until termination. The engine returns
              the resulting P&amp;L, and your systems treat it as they would treat any other structured payoff:
              settlement, booking and reporting follow your normal procedures.

          CRL is not a trading venue or a book of record. It is a leverage engine that sits inside your
          existing stack. The path to production is incremental: you start with read-only visibility,
          then move to a small, hedged pilot, and only scale once risk, P&amp;L and capital impact are
          fully understood.

        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          From an engineering perspective, CRL is an authenticated API layer and a stateful engine behind it.
          It is designed to look familiar to teams that already integrate with trading, pricing or risk APIs
          and to fit into your existing security and monitoring practices, without introducing a new book of record.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          <strong>Security &amp; reliability by design.</strong> CRL is built as a narrow, zero-trust engine behind an
          authenticated API layer. All traffic is protected with TLS 1.3 and mutual TLS, plus per-request HMAC-SHA256
          signing with anti-replay windows. HMAC keys are tenant-scoped and never embedded in the SDK pack; production
          keys are issued separately and stored in your own secure secret store or KMS, and can be rotated without
          changing the signing logic.

              public test credentials shipped in the HMAC SDK pack are isolated from live tenants and heavily
              rate-limited. Production keys are delivered out-of-band, stored in your own secure secret store or KMS,

              for the audit log are signed through AWS KMS, stored in S3 buckets with object-lock/WORM policies and
              exposed via Prometheus exporters so your risk and internal audit teams can independently verify integrity

        <h2 class="headline">Developer integration and HMAC SDK pack</h2>

        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          For institutional developer teams, CRL ships with a small, opinionated integration pack.
          The engine is exposed as an authenticated REST API with HMAC-signed requests; the SDK pack
          gives your team a working reference implementation so you do not have to reverse-engineer
          the signing rules from scratch.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          The pack includes a Postman collection and environment for <code>HMAC v1</code>, together
          with minimal client stubs in Python, TypeScript/Node.js, Java, C# and Go. Each language
          uses the same golden test vector: if the request you send reproduces the expected hash and
          signature and returns <code>201 Created</code> on our side, your implementation is correct.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          The SDK pack contains no production credentials and is safe to share with your internal teams. Public
          test credentials used for the <code>HMAC v1</code> golden vector are isolated from live tenants and
          heavily rate-limited. Production keys are issued under NDA via out-of-band channels and are intended
          to live in your own secure secret store or KMS, not in application code.
        </p>

            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              A self-contained archive with a Postman collection, environment, HMAC helper functions,
              a golden request/response pair and a small test script. It is designed to be read and
              copied into your existing stack, not to replace your internal SDK conventions. 
              The SDK pack focuses on HMAC authentication and uses a minimal example payload.
              Product-specific fields such as leverage, triggers and TTL are defined at product level and can be added to the same signed JSON body without changing the signing logic

            <p style="margin-top:8px;">
              Your team downloads the pack, runs the golden test against our API and then wires the
              same signing logic into your own pricing or order layer. From there, CRL behaves like any
              other internal service: authenticated HTTP calls, clear JSON payloads, deterministic
              responses that you can monitor and log with your current tools.

              The SDK pack is provided for institutional use only and assumes a professional
              development environment (version control, CI, secure secret storage). If you prefer,
              we can prepare a tenant-specific sandbox and keys for your team as part of a structured

        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          CRL is delivered strictly as a business-to-business calculation engine. We are not a
          broker-dealer, we do not execute trades, we do not hold client assets and we do not
          face your end-clients directly. Your institution remains fully responsible for product
          governance, client classification, suitability / appropriateness, disclosures and
          regulatory reporting.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          In practice, CRL operates as a configurable software component inside your existing
          framework and under your own approvals. You decide which client segments and instruments
          may access CRL-based structures, how they are labelled, and what level of leverage and
          risk is appropriate for each segment.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:780px;">
          Any quantitative statements we make (for example, the 60–75% reduction in early account
          wipe-outs and the 5–6 month increase in median relationship duration) are anchored in a
          documented Monte Carlo simulation with clearly stated assumptions and limitations. We apply
          a conservative haircut to all figures used in external communications, and we provide the
          full technical note so your risk and model-validation teams can review or reproduce the
          results.
        </p>
        <p class="caption" style="margin-top:16px;">
          Full methodology, assumptions and code are available in the CRL Quantitative Evidence
          Report, shared under NDA as part of the gated documentation pack for qualified
          institutions.

        <p style="margin-top:12px;max-width:720px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
          The most useful conversation is not abstract. It is to look at how CRL would sit next to your current
          products, platforms and risk views, and what a small, controlled pilot would look like.
