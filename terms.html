          <h2 style="font-size:1.25rem;margin-bottom:12px;">1. About these Terms</h2>

            (the "Site"). The Site is operated by CRL Technologies, Inc. ("CRL", "we", "us", "our").
            By accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not
            agree, you must not use the Site.
          </p>

          <h2 style="font-size:1.25rem;margin:24px 0 12px;">2. Professional and institutional audience only</h2>
          <p>
            The information on this Site is directed exclusively at professional and institutional
            counterparties, such as investment firms, banks and similar regulated entities, in
            jurisdictions where they may lawfully receive such information. It is not intended for
            retail clients or the general public.
          </p>

          <h2 style="font-size:1.25rem;margin:24px 0 12px;">3. No offer, no advice</h2>
          <p>The content on this Site is provided for general information purposes only. Nothing on the Site constitutes:</p>
          <ul style="margin-top:12px;padding-left:20px;">
            <li>investment, legal, tax, accounting or other professional advice;</li>
            <li>an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any financial instrument; or</li>
            <li>a recommendation regarding any investment strategy or product.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top:12px;">
            Any decision to engage with CRL or to structure, market or offer any product remains
            the sole responsibility of the relevant institution and must be taken in accordance
            with its own internal policies, risk appetite and regulatory obligations.
          </p>

          <h2 style="font-size:1.25rem;margin:24px 0 12px;">4. Nature of CRL's services</h2>
          <p>CRL develops and licenses calculation engine software and related tools to regulated financial institutions. We do not:</p>

          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top:12px;">
            Our institutional customers remain fully responsible for product governance, client
            classification, suitability and appropriateness assessments, disclosures, and any
            regulatory reporting associated with their use of CRL-based structures.
          </p>
